## Beta 16

- Fixed self-updater, hopefully.
- Revamped toolbar and displayed current profile under Profiles.
- VRAM estimation now reads your GraphicsLib settings, if any. Previously assumed you had maxed GraphicsLib settings, even if it wasn't enabled.
- Fixed a mod getting copied to its own mod folder when you tried to install the same version again and canceled the confirmation dialog.
- Fixed possible crash when hovering over mod profiles.
- Fixed possible crash if a tip.json had a null tips array.
- Added setting to choose your SMOL renderer.
- Maybe added a deadlock. Not sure. Might've fixed it. Let me know if it softlocks.
- Many various little text improvements, e.g. making the "not yet scanned" text more obvious but subtle.
